another beginning...
when life starts new ways and possibilities blossom 
from the deepest trenches of nothingness
where destination is a delusion 
and hope is an unlawful act.

Thank God for Life and Hope,  
hope so strong that it shines till it 
engulfs us inside out in an overwhelming wisdom of faith!

So be glad there is another beginning...
